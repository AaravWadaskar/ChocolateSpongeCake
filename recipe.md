You must have the biscuits in hand at first and then in the mixer. Grind the biscuits to produce fine powder. If you have gone with cocoa powder, there is no need to do any of this. Mix any one of the two in milk and do add a fine amount of powdered sugar in the mixture. Egg isn't a mandatory part of the cake mixture but it will just do it's bit and affect the taste only by a tiny bit. Mix all the ingredients to form a proper mixture. This is at last that you are supposed to add a bit of baking soda. This will make the cake fluffy with air cavities. Make sure that you stir the mixture in only one direction after the addition of baking soda. The mixture now needs to be baked at Medium heat. The timeperiod for the cake to be baked depends on the quantity of the batter of the cake. On an average it will take 7' for the cake to be ready before being cooled down for about 10'.
